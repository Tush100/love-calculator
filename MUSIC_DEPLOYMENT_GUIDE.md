# Music Deployment Guide for Tush Love Calculator

## The Issue
The music files work in v0 preview but not on your deployed Vercel website because blob URLs don't get transferred during deployment.

## Solution: Manual File Upload

### Step 1: Download Your Music Files
You have these 6 songs that need to be uploaded:
1. **Perfect** - Ed Sheeran (`perfect-ed-sheeran.mp3`)
2. **All of Me** - John Legend (`john-legend-all-of-me.mp3`) 
3. **Make You Feel My Love** - Adele (`adele-make-you-feel-my-love.mp3`)
4. **Unity** - Sapphire (`sapphire-unity-acoustic.mp3`)
5. **Leave The Door Open** - Bruno Mars (`leave-the-door-open-bruno-mars.mp3`)
6. **We Found Love** - Rihanna ft. Calvin Harris (`we-found-love-rihanna.mp3`)

### Step 2: Create Folder Structure
In your project, create this folder structure:
\`\`\`
your-project/
├── public/
│   └── audio/
│       ├── perfect-ed-sheeran.mp3
│       ├── john-legend-all-of-me.mp3
│       ├── adele-make-you-feel-my-love.mp3
│       ├── sapphire-unity-acoustic.mp3
│       ├── leave-the-door-open-bruno-mars.mp3
│       └── we-found-love-rihanna.mp3
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Upload Files
1. Create the `public/audio/` folder in your project
2. Upload all 6 MP3 files with the exact names shown above
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. Vercel will automatically redeploy

### Step 4: Verify
After deployment, the music player will:
- Try the direct blob URLs first (for v0 preview)
- Fall back to `/audio/filename.mp3` (for your deployed site)
- Show helpful error messages if files are missing

## Alternative: Use External Music Hosting
If you prefer, you can also:
1. Upload files to a service like Cloudinary, AWS S3, or Google Drive
2. Update the URLs in the music player component
3. Ensure CORS is properly configured

## Current Status
- ✅ Music player code is ready
- ✅ Fallback system implemented  
- ❌ Music files need manual upload to `/public/audio/`
- ❌ Deployment needed after file upload

Once you upload the files and redeploy, "Perfect" by Ed Sheeran will auto-play when users visit your site!
